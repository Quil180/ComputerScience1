int main() {
  // time for stacks:
  // its last in, first out (whatever you put in last, is the first thing you
  // take out)
  // think of like a pringles can

  // but what are its uses???
  // - for program execution (what the compiler does during the parsing stage)
  // - evaluating expressions ( a / b - c + d * e - a * c)
  // - back button on the browser
  // - search paths in a graph
  // - validating the balance of paranthesis

  // but how do we make this "stack"?
  // for queues:
  // - push (adds an item to the top of the stack)
  // - pop (gets and then removes the most recent item)
  // - isEmpty (checks if the stack is empty)
  // - isFull (checks if the stack is full)
  // - peek (gets the most recent item but doesnt remove it from the stack)
